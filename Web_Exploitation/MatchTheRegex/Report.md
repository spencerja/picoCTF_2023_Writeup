# MatchTheRegex
## Description
How about trying to match a regular expression The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:49351/).

---
Going to the page, we see an input box to input our search. Based on the name, my first thought is that this will be a regular expression search, where we must input a regex term that will hit positive for specifically the flag. After trying several different regex queries, I'm not having any luck. Looking at the page source, I notice a hint displayed in comments:
```html
<script>
	function send_request() {
		let val = document.getElementById("name").value;
		// ^p.....F!?
		fetch(`/flag?input=${val}`)
			.then(res => res.text())
			.then(res => {
				const res_json = JSON.parse(res);
				alert(res_json.flag)
				return false;
			})
		return false;
	}

</script>
```
`^p.....F!?`
In regex searches, ^ refers to the start of a line and $ refers to the end of a line, so perhaps this hint can be a working query?

Unfortunately not..
Playing with the provided hint a little more, I get a successful match by being more generic:

Despite being a regex based search, and the commented page source including the ^ marker for the beginning of a line, including the ^ in our search causes it to fail..
