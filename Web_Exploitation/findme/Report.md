Upon logging in, we cycle through a couple blank pages very quickly before landing at `http://saturn.picoctf.net:54197/home`. The page contains a search bar and a small note:
"I was redirected here by a friend of mine but i couldnt find anything. Help me search for flags :-)"

Searching for a few keywords leads us to no result. The note on this page mentions the redirects as well, so let's use burpsuite to catch and analyze each step that's occuring.
First login request:

First redirect:

Second redirect:

Then finally we are sent to home. There isn't much to go on aside from the second redirec has an id value that looks like base64 encoding. Decoding the sring:
```
$ echo "bF90aGVfd2F5XzAxZTc0OGRifQ==" | base64 -d
l_the_way_01e748db}
```
This is looking like half of a flag. Combining the two id values together and base64 decoding might get us the flag:

```
echo "cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2FsbF90aGVfd2F5XzAxZTc0OGRifQ==" | base64 -d
picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_01e748db}
```
